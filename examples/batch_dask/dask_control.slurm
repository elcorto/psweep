# Submit this job manually via "sbatch <this_script>". It will run on some node
# and from there submit the batch jobs to spin up the dask cluster defined in
# run_psweep.py. The dask cluster will then run workloads. After all work is
# done, the dask cluster will be teared down and this job will exit.
#
# The reason for using a batch job to run the dask control process (so python
# run_psweep.py) is that typically on HPC machines, there is a time limit for
# user processes started on the head / login nodes. Therefore the dask control
# process may get killed before the dask workers have finished processing.
