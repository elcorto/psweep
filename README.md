This package helps you to set up and run parameter studies.

Mostly, you'll start with a script and a for-loop and ask "why do I
need a package for that"? Well, soon you'll want housekeeping tools
and a database for your runs and results. This package exists because
sooner or later, everyone doing parameter scans arrives at roughly the
same workflow and tools.
